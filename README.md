# This app tracks gameplay time for pool tables

Title says it all.

TODOs:

1. Need session repo.
2. Take note of todos.
3. Check how the price is stored. We might want to store it rounded up.
4. Bring the API endpoints, write controllers.
5. Minimal frontend.

Instead of time reamining do play for money.
Switch goes off on standby.
Remainder of money should be accounted.`
One card one discount.
