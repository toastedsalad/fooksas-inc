# This app tracks gameplay time for pool tables

Title says it all.

TODOs:

1. Start clalculating session rates.
2. Then we probably need some service to create multiple tables. But not sure about that.
3. How do we make schedule configuration easier.
From 9:00 to 14:00   >> 9:00 to 13:59
From 14:00 to 23:00  >> 14:00 to 23:00
4. Some more tests around scheduling at rate change time is needed.
